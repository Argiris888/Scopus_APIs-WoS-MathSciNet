The main objectives of this thesis are twofold. The first objective concerns finding a programmatic way using the API's provided by Scopus and the R programming language to retrieve and organize bibliographic information related to the publications of the journal Transactions of the American Mathematical Society from the beginning of its publication until the year 2020. The second objective is to find the joint publications of the journal Transactions of the American Mathematical Society of the period 1900-2020 between the bibliographic databases Scopus, Web Of Science (WoS) and MathSciNet and compare the journal publication information provided by these three bases.
